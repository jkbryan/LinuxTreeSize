# LinuxTreeSize
Copy of script from here http://blog.aclarke.eu/2011/09/21/a-simple-treesize-shell-script-for-linux/ 

I needed a simple way of finding out why my disk was full and a simple way of getting this script onto my unix host.

Navigate to the level that you want to query - for me this was /

Then run the script:

sudo sh /home/pi/LinuxTreeSize/treesize.sh
